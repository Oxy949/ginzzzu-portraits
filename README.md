# Ginzzzu's Portraits & NPC Dock
A system-independent Foundry VTT module that brings a cinematic layer to your Foundry VTT games.
It displays character and NPC portraits directly on screen — much like a visual novel or dialogue-driven RPG. 

The module provides:

🎭 Dynamic portraits for PCs and NPCs with smooth animation transitions.

💬 NPC Dock, a visual panel bar for managing and displaying characters on screen that remembers sorting between worlds, supports folder-based sorting etc.

⚙️ Customizable layout, including sliders for portrait size, spacing, and screen offsets.

✨ Stylized UI with glass panels, glowing edges, and adaptive transparency.

This module integrates seamlessly with other Foundry features and can be used both for roleplay storytelling and combat visualization for any gaming system.

## Installation
1. Copy https://github.com/Oxy949/ginzzzu-portraits/releases/latest/download/module.json
2. Paste it in your Foundry VTT, wait for install
3. Enable the module in your world
4. Enjoy!

# Usage
After installing, you’ll find a PC/NPC control panel at the bottom of your screen — an intuitive way to manage all your character portraits right on the tabletop.

## Panel controls
- **Left-click** — add or remove portraits on the screen.
- **Right-click** — open the character sheet for any PC or NPC.
- **Middle-click** — add PCs or NPCs to **Favorites** to keep important characters at the front.
- **Drag** actor cards from the dock onto the canvas to create tokens.
- **Scroll** the mouse wheel to browse portraits.
- **Clear the screen** by pressing the `Clear All` button (red, top-right).
- **Toggle panel visibility** by pressing the `Show/Hide Panel` button (gray, top-right).
- **Folder selection**: use the folder dropdown to select an **actors** folder with portraits.
- **Quick search**: use `Search` field to filter portraits by name or folder path.

## Portrait controls
- **Middle-click a portrait** to highlight it and dim the others (adjustable in `Settings`).

## Useful tips
- Folder colors match each portrait’s background or outline for quick visual grouping.
- Use the `(Scene)` option to show portraits only for characters with tokens on the current scene.
- Dynamic lighting support: portraits dim with scene darkness for deeper immersion (adjustable in `Settings`).
- Right-click an actor in the **Actors** list (top-right panel) and select **“Show portrait”**, or use the top-right button in the character sheet to instantly display the portrait.
- Use `Settings` to configure the module to your preferences.
